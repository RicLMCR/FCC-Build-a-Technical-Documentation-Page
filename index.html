            <p>Whether it's enabling god mode, killing all nearby enemies, spawning unlimited items, banning players with server admin commands, starting random events, and even entering Creative Mode, IGN has you covered as we guide you through everything you need to know about enabling cheats and using console commands in the survival PC game, Valheim.</p>

            <h2>How to Enable Cheats</h2>

            <p>To start using cheats and other general console commands in Valheim, you will need to press F5 in order to bring up the console command box.</p>

            <p>Before you can continue delving into the world of cheats, you will need to ensure that cheats are activated by typing "imacheater". However, it is worth noting that cheats can only be used in singleplayer and will not work on multiplayer servers.</p>

            <p>In order to turn cheats off, simply retype "imacheater" into the console command box and watch as cheats are turned to false.</p>
            <code>iamacheater</code>
            <p>Note: This command has now been updated. It is no longer 'iamachester'. Instead type in 'devcommands' to access the console.</p>
            <code>devcommands</code>
        </section>

            <header><h1>How to Spawn Any Item and Monster</h1></header>
            <p strong>WARNING: Please use the Spawn Item cheat at your own risk, as cheating can not only ruin your in-game experience but the items and quantity that use spawn into your world could potentially cause bugs, glitches, and possibly even break your world.</p>

            <p>In order to spawn items through the console command cheat, you will need to firstly enable cheats by typing "imacheater". Once you have successfully enable cheats, you will need to use the following code to spawn any item that you specify:</p>

            <code>spawn [item] [quantity] [level]</code>

            <p>For those that may be new to using console commands, we have compiled an example code below that spawns in 50 Wood.</p>

            <code>spawn Wood 50</code>

            <p>Thankfully, Reddit user Demogrim has done the hard work for us and has complied a complete list of all spawnable items and their required code. Some popular item spawn codes include:</p>
            <code>
            <ul>
                <li>AxeBronze</li>
                <li>AxeBlackMetal</li>
                <li>ArmorWolfChest</li>

                <li>Wishbone</li>
                <li>Coins</li>
                <p class="aside">WARNING: Haldor the Merchant will spawn approximately one foot off the ground and cannot be removed from your game afterwards.</p>            
                </ul>
